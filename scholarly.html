                This product is meant to be of use for students and teachers that want to solve and propose problems
                related to computer
                science. Teachers can use the apllication to create classes end evaluate their students, based on
                assigned homeworks.

            <h3>1.2 Product Scope</h3>
            <p>
                The product is a web application designed for high school students to learn programming through
                problems. The application allows registered users to create, submit, and approve programming problems.
                The problems are tagged according to their difficulty level and programming concepts, such as dynamic
                programming and backtracking.
                The application allows teachers to create classes and add students, who have existing accounts, using
                their email or username. Teachers can also assign homework by selecting problems from the existing
                collection or proposing new ones.
                Students can solve the assigned problems and submit their solutions for evaluation by the teacher. They
                can also leave comments to provide hints or rate the problems using a star rating system.

                    <p>
                        Our platform is designed to help users solve programming problems through a community-driven
                        approach. Upon accessing the platform, you will be welcomed by the main page, which contains
                        links to almost every other page. The top menu includes buttons for Home, Problems, About,
                        Login, and Sign-up, while the left bottom corner of the page has a Help button.
                    </p>

                        menu. You will then be taken to a form to register/enter your account information. Once you are
                        done filling out the form, the buttons in the top menu will be replaced by the Profile page.

                        page. Here, you can see the problem description, comments left by other users, a solution page
                        where you can see your past solutions, and a coding area where you can write your solution.

                        From this page you can see the statistics based on your overall performance. They are divided into 4 categories, 
                        depending on the difficulty of the problems solved: all, easy, medium and hard. <br> Below the role there are some links. <br>
                        If you are a student, then you have 2 buttons. One is called "class" and it takes you to the page related to the class you belong to, 
                        and the other one is called "logout", it takes you to the main page and the button Profile from the top menu will be replaced by the Login/Sign-up buttons.<br> 
                        If you are a teacher, then you have 3 buttons. The logout button works the same. Instead of the "class" button, you have the "classes" 
                        button that takes you to the page related to the classes you have. In addition, you have the button "propose problem".
